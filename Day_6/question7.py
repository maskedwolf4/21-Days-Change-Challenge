**Question:** Write a function to compute the Dice coefficient (similarity) between two sets.

**Input:** `set1={"gene1","gene2","gene3"}, set2={"gene2","gene4","gene5"}`

**Expected Output:** `0.333`

**Usage:** Comparing sample overlaps in cohort selection; quantifying annotation similarity; feature selection in omics data
