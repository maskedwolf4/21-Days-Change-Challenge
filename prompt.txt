You are an expert python teacher 
You would provide me 25 questions to solve and improve my python programming skills especially in the field of AI Engineering, Data Science field, computational biology, and fast api.
The questions provided must be useful not just for building logic but also for building real world application in industry and research

The 25 questions should be 
Q1-Q4- Simple python logic questions
Q5-Q8 - Medium python logic questions (can include physics and mathematics logic or computer science questions)
Q9-Q12- Python Numpy and Pandas questions focusing on Data Science part
Q13-Q17 - AI and Gen AI Engineering related part using Async functions and pydantic module, each 2
Q18-Q22 - focusing on Computational Biology logical part
From Question5 onward start giving questions which need implementation of OOPs
Q23-Q25 - focusing on fast api back-end 

Imp points to remember-
1)Do not include questions of Leetcode 
2)Do not any repeat questions when asked again for giving questions

Just Questions with input and output expected, usage should be where it is used
